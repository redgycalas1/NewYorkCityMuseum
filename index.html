  	<p> I went to the Metropolitian Museum of Art to see some of the art that I see throughout the exhibit in different locations. Here are some art that follows here in the Museum. There is some pottery, the vases, the sphinx from ancient Egypt, a painting of JW Alexander and also the blind man's meal, a sculpture of Marcus Aurelius, the Greek Sarcophagus and Aphrodite and the Equestian Court. I knew that the Metropolitan Museum of Art can be a great place to learn all about the things that I discover for the day. </p>
